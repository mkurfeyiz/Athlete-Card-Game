# Athlete-Card-Game

A little,basic card game which compares both players's cards and decides the winner.There are 2 types of cards:Football and Basketball Cards.
These cards have different types of abilities.In a round,app chooses an ability randomly and then it compares cards by choosen ability.
Higher ability score means victory.If a round's result is tie,then app chooses another ability and then compares these cards by that ability again.
App's backend is finished as asked but frontend of it is a kinda mess at the moment.Will try to fix it later.
